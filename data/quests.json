          "Create a new file `day2_if_else.py` and practice decision making:\n- Ask the user for a number with `input()` and convert it to `int`.\n- If the number is greater than 10, print `That’s a big number!`; otherwise, print `That’s a small number or equal to 10.` using an `if` and `else` block.\n- Add another condition: if the number is exactly 10, print `You chose exactly ten!` using `elif`.",

          "Create a new file `day2_loops.py` and practice loops using `for`:\n- Use `for i in range(5):` to print the numbers 0–4.\n- Modify the loop to print from 1–5 instead.\n- Add a second loop that prints each character in the string `\"code\"` on its own line.",
          "In `day2_loops.py`, add a simple `while` loop example:\n- Set `count = 3`.\n- While `count` is greater than 0, print `Countdown:` and the value of `count`, then subtract 1 from `count` each time through the loop.\n- After the loop ends, print `Go!`.\nAdd comments explaining when the loop stops.",
          "Create a mini calculator program in a new file `day2_calculator.py`:\n- Ask the user for two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).\n- Use `if/elif` to perform the correct operation on the numbers.\n- Print the result with a clear message.\n- Handle at least one error case: if the user enters an operation you don’t recognize, print an error message instead of crashing.",
          "Create a simple guessing game in a new file `day2_guess.py`:\n- Set a secret number between 1 and 10 (hard-code it in the code, e.g., `secret = 7`).\n- Use a `while` loop to allow the user to guess until they are correct.\n- After each guess, print whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n- When they guess correctly, print a congratulatory message and end the loop.",
          "At the end of the day, open all of today’s files and re-read them once. Add at least three new comments total (spread across any of the files) explaining why you used `if`, `elif`, `while`, or `for` in specific places."

          "Plan your program with comments before writing the code:\n- At the top of your file, write a comment block describing what your program will do in 3–5 lines.\n- Write a step-by-step outline as comments, for example:\n  - `# 1. Greet the user`\n  - `# 2. Explain the rules`\n  - `# 3. Ask for input...`\n  - `# 4. Use a loop to repeat...`\n  - `# 5. Use if/else to check answers or conditions`\nThis outline is your \"pseudocode\" guide.",

          "Enhance your program with user-friendly details:\n- Print clear instructions at the beginning so someone else could use it without reading the code.\n- Add helpful messages after user actions (e.g., `You have 2 guesses left`, `Task added!`, `Your current score is 3`).\n- Handle at least one error or unexpected input using `if` (e.g., if the user types something other than `1`, `2`, or `3` for a menu choice, show an error and ask again).",
          "Test your program thoroughly:\n- Run it at least three times with different choices or inputs.\n- Intentionally try to \"break\" it by entering unexpected values (like letters instead of numbers) and observe what happens.\n- Each time you find a bug or confusing behavior, go back to the code, add a comment near the problem, and try to fix it or improve your messages.",
          "Clean up and document your final project:\n- Remove any unused code or stray print statements that were only for debugging.\n- At the top of the file, update the comment block to include: your name, the date, the program’s name, and a one-sentence summary of what it does.\n- Add short comments to any tricky parts of the code so that a future beginner could understand your logic.",
          "Reflect briefly on your 3-day journey by adding a final comment block at the very bottom of `day3_project.py` starting with `# Reflection` and answering in 3–5 lines:\n- What are two coding concepts you feel more comfortable with now?\n- What is one thing you still find confusing or want to learn next?\n- How did it feel to build a complete, working program?"
